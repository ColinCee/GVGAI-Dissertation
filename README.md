# GVGAI-Dissertation

This is the code used for implementing DQN to GVGAI, you will need to clone this repository and the GVGAI repository then paste this into the python client folder in the GVGAI repo.

Futhermore I have used Anaconda3 to manage my python packages.

The following is the package list used for this project:

keras
tensorflow
h5py
matplotlib
pillow
opencv

Note that different implementations are stored in separate branches.
